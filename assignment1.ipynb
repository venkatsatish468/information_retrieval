abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern science how could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and the eventfulness of recent advances but the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their discoveries in ways that could be understanded of the people no one objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht and they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description it is certain however that they can be reduced to a minimum without sacrificing accuracy when the object in view is to explain the gist of the matter so this outline of science is meant for the general reader who lacks both time and opportunity for special study and yet would take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making the world always new the story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which man may well be proud science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises the atom foretells the date of the comet s return and predicts the kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs discovers the laws of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the disorder of disease science is always setting forth on columbus voyages discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding for knowledge means foresight and foresight means power the idea of evolution has influenced all the sciences forcing us to think of everything as with a history behind it for we have travelled far since darwin s day the solar system the earth the mountain ranges and the great deeps the rocks and crystals the plants and animals man himself and his social institutions all must be seen as the outcome of a long process of becoming there are some eighty odd chemical elements on the earth to day and it is now much more than a suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution element giving rise to element going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they were all originally derived infinitely long ago no idea has been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of new knowledge as this simple but profound idea of evolution that the present is the child of the past and the parent of the future and with the picture of a continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of an increasing control a promise that man will become not only a more accurate student but a more complete master of his world it is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to be more vital than before everywhere there has been a passage from the static to the dynamic thus the new revelations of the constitution of matter which we owe to the discoveries of men like professor sir j j thomson professor sir ernest rutherford and professor frederick soddy have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore unimagined such phrases as dead matter and inert matter have gone by the board the new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the universe it bids fair to reveal to us many of nature s hidden secrets the atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once understood to be we know now that there is an atom within the atom that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken up the present day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as radium the x rays and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments the advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what before was hidden or only dimly guessed at it has given us a new conception of the framework of the universe we are beginning to know and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean we can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter the new knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena not only of our own planet but other planets of the stars and the sun new light is thrown on the source of the sun s heat we can make more than guesses as to its probable age the great question to day is is there one primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter have been evolved but the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes which give modern science an entrancing interest as in chemistry and physics so in the science of living creatures there have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect a good instance is afforded by the discovery of the hormones or chemical messengers which are produced by ductless glands such as the thyroid the supra renal and the pituitary and are distributed throughout the body by the blood the work of physiologists like professor starling and professor bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what may be called the pace of the body and bring about that regulated harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health it is not too much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of physiology our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the past generation\n"
